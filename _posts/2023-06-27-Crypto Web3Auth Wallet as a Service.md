With Web3Auth infrastructure, a cryptocurrency signing key is divided into multiple parts and stored across the userâ€™s devices, as well as the Web3Auth network. The objective is to ensure that the key is always available without a central point of attack. A Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is used to produce the final signed blockchain transaction.
