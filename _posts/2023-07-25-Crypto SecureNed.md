NCSC-NL accelerates the collection and distribution of sensitive cyber threat intel, by offering a safe, and privacy-preserving environment for participants to share information with each other.

Participants are able to accessibly report digital attacks by completing short surveys. SecureNed uses an MPC protocol developed by [Roseman Labs](https://www.rosemanlabs.com) to collect private analytics on participant data. Participants can then know whether others are experiencing the same digital attack, and take appropriate subsequent measures.
